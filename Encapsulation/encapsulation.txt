Encapsulation:
1 binding the class members(variable and methods) into single  unit.
2 and all data members are declared as private only 
3.By providing setter and getter method we can read-only or write-only
 
 advantages :

 control over the data
 data hiding
 data will be secure and not be accessed by other personal details.
 Encapsulation=data hiding+Abstraction.

Real time example:

Suppose you have an account in the bank. 
If your balance variable is declared as a public variable in the bank software, 
your account balance will be known as public,
In this case, anyone can know your account balance.
So, would you like it? Obviously No.
So, they declare balance variable as private for making your account safe, 
so that anyone cannot see your account balance.
The person who has to see his account balance, will have to access only private members through methods defined 
inside that class and this method will ask your account holder name or user Id, and password for authentication.
Thus, we can achieve security by utilizing the concept of data hiding. This is called Encapsulation in Java.


example:

public class Student {
	
	private String name;
	private int Student_id;
	private double phoneno;
	private String state;
	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}
	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
	public int getStudent_id() {
		return Student_id;
	}
	public void setStudent_id(int student_id) {
		Student_id = student_id;
	}
	public double getPhoneno() {
		return phoneno;
	}
	public void setPhoneno(int phoneno) {
		this.phoneno = phoneno;
	}
	public String getState() {
		return state;
	}
	public void setState(String state) {
		this.state = state;
	}
	@Override
	public String toString() {
		return "Student [name=" + name + ", Student_id=" + Student_id + ", phoneno=" + phoneno + ", state=" + state
				+ "]";
	}
	public Student(String name, int student_id, double phoneno, String state) {
		super();
		this.name = name;
		Student_id = student_id;
		this.phoneno = phoneno;
		this.state = state;
	}
	
	

}
public class Test {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

Student st=new Student("joshna", 123, 9573562232L, "america");
System.out.println(st);


		

	}

}
output:
Student [name=joshna, Student_id=123, phoneno=9.573562232E9, state=america]
